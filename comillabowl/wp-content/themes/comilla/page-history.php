                On Dec. 20, 2014, the inaugural Camellia Bowl kicked off at the historic Cramton Bowl in Montgomery, Alabama
              </span> <br><br>
              The Cramton Bowl has played host to Major League Baseball, minor league baseball and plenty of football. The stadium has the designation of having been the first in the South to feature a football game under the lights, a night game pitting Cloverdale against Pike Road High School in 1927. The game drew more than 7,200 attendees and helped prompt a stadium seating expansion in 1929. Cramton Bowl is also formerly the home of the Blue-Gray Football Classic college football game. The Alabama Crimson Tide played home games in the capital city at Cramton Bowl from 1922 to 1932 and in various years through 1954.
